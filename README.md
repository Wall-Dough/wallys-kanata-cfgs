# wallys-kanata-cfgs

Implementations of [ARTSEY](https://artsey.io/) using [kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata).

The "two-handed" version was meant to allow for the left-hand and right-hand configurations to act as separate contexts so you could quickly and responsively alternate left and right for typing in artsey with two hands. The "one-handed version" is a far simpler and more attractive config file. You probably just want the one-handed version, but I'll probably keep updating both because the two-handed idea is funny, and configuration for kanata is fun.
